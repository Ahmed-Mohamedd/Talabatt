# Talabat API Project
This project is an e-commerce platform that utilizes the Entity Framework and LINQ for data access, the Onion Architecture and Repository Pattern for separation of concerns, and the Unit of Work and Specification Pattern for building efficient queries. The project follows the principles of the Clean Architecture, also known as the “Onion Architecture” which promotes separation of concerns and maintainability. The Repository pattern is used to abstract the data access layer and provide a consistent interface for querying the database. The Unit of Work pattern is used to manage the context and transaction of the Entity Framework. The Specification pattern is used to build complex queries in a composable and maintainable way. This project is built to handle large amounts of data and provide a scalable solution to e-commerce needs 1.
